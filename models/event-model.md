  We recorded the webinar "What Structured Content Can Do For You: Event Model" on June 13, 2014.  In it, we discussed what a structured content model is, what open and structured content models can do for your agency, and provided an overview of the working groupâ€™s Event content model, including demonstrating its application from a content and technical perspective.  We also provided an update of the Content Model discussion on GitHub.
