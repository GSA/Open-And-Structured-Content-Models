description: >
  Article is a basic type of content that is used on government websites. The goal of this model is to articulate a structure for a general article based on the schema.org model for article. This model is not intended to be an exhaustive and detailed model of all possible elements that define the structure of an article. Others can extend the model and add more specificity to the model if so desired. This content model does not address print-only articles.

    We recorded the webinar "What Structured Content Can Do For You: Article Model" on May 16, 2014.  In it, we discussed what structured content models are and how they can help you create content that is platform-agnostic, format-free, and device-independent.  We also discussed the article content model.
